This is a simple Python script that uses EasyOCR to extract text from a PDF file. 

# Installation
pip install easyocr

Place pdf2txt.py wherever you want it

# Usage
python pdf2txt.py <PDF file name> 
This software works offline, however it will download any required EasyOCR models that are required on first use.

The output can be piped to other software like any other text output in Linux.

# Custom apps available
